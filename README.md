CS300 Reflection
#Problem Solved: I worked on improving data processing and analysis by choosing good data structures and using algorithms effectively.
#Approach: I carefully selected data structures like arrays, trees, or graphs to make the tasks faster and easier. Understanding data structures is important because they help complete tasks efficiently.
#Overcoming Roadblocks: When I faced problems, I broke them into smaller parts, used debugging tools, and tried different ideas until I found the solution.
#Expanded Approach: This project helped me learn how to plan better, design good algorithms, and make my software more organized.
#Improved Programming Style: I now write cleaner code with comments and follow rules like avoiding repeated code. This makes my programs easier to understand, fix, and update.

Operation	Vector	Hash Table	Binary Search Tree
Load Data	O(n)	O(n)	O(n log n)
Print All Courses (Sorted)	O(n log n)	O(n log n)	O(n)
Search for a Course	O(n)	O(1)	O(log n)
Memory Usage
Data Structure	Memory Usage
Vector	Medium (due to resizing)
Hash Table	High (especially when collide)
Binary Search Tree	Medium (due to pointer)
